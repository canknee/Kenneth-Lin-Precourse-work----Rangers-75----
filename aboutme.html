                <hr>Hullo, my name is Kenneth, Kenny, or Ken - whichever but usually not Kenneth. That's me on the
                left. <br><br>I was born in Queens, NY but pretty much grew up in central Massachusetts.
                <hr>
                <br>Before making the decision to fully transition into programming, I was working full time doing
                stem cell research for a Japanese biopharmaceutical company.
                <br><br>I decided to make the switch because:
                <br>98% of my friends are also in the tech
                <br>I had no desire to continue in the bioindustry field
                <br>The work-life balance that tech jobs provide was very appealing compared to the overtime/weekend
                work I had to do as a research associate. <br><br>

            <hr><br>I've probably put tens of thousands of hours into just these games alone. I used to travel accross the United States to both spectate and compete at video game tournaments and events!
            <br><br>These days, especially thanks to COVID, I've been enjoying spending time at home and not needing to go out.
